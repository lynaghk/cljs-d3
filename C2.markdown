DRAFT: C2 will get its own git repository in late October.
==========================================================

I'm just sketching out ideas for a D3-inspired Clojure data visualization library.
If you've got ideas about how this kind of thing should look, definitely shoot me an email (or, if you're in Portland, OR, lets get a beer).

C2
==

C2 is a declarative data visualization library that generates static SVG.
It's like D3, but written in Clojure and less fancy!


Design Goals
------------

The two eminent goals of C2 are composability and simplicity of expression.

Composability is achieved in the traditional functional-programming way: breaking things up into small pieces.
In the case of C2, the fundamental visual pieces are SVG `<g>` elements, and the fundamental statistical pieces are closures.
The `<g>` elements depict things like axes, parts of legends, sets of marks, &c.

// (pictures please!)

and the closures are different scales and statistical transforms that aggregate (e.g., histograms) or smooth / regress (e.g., best-fit models).

To make a C2 visualization, you explicitly apply transforms to your data, build fundamental visual elements, and then lay out these elements.

C2 provides a constraint-based layout system to place graphics according to both essential (i.e., data-driven) and incidental (e.g., margin + max-label-width) considerations.

// See: [Cocoa autolayout](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/UserExperience/RNAutomaticLayout/_index.html)
// How hard would it be to implement something like CSS flexbox to do things like justify the bars on a bar chart?

Using declarative constraints between graphics rather than absolutely positioning low-level DOM elements prevents incidental layout concerns from tainting the essential visualization mappings, making graphics more reusable.










The simplicity of expression comes from Clojure; the C2 API embraces Clojure idioms like destructuring and laziness, and makes generous use of multi-arity functions.
This gives C2 a concise, jQuery-like flavor compared to D3.
Occasionally, C2 sacrifices absolute transparency for user-simplicity to sweep SVG DOM awkwardness under the rug and embrace best practices.
For instance, while you can still say

```clojure
(append "svg:svg") ;;=> <svg></svg>
```

you almost always want

```clojure
(append :svg) ;;=> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
              ;;        xmlns:ev="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events"
              ;;        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></svg>
```

(see [SVG authoring guidelines](https://jwatt.org/svg/authoring/))

Append also accepts a map of attributes, which is macro-expanded into a scope with a map-datum's values as locals.
That is, you can write

```clojure
(-> g-element
    (data [{:x 1 :y 2}, {:x 4 :y 0}])
    (append :circle {:cx x :cy y}))
```

which is equivalent to D3

```javascript
g_element.data([{x: 1, y: 2}, {x: 4 y: 0}])
  .enter()
  .append("svg:circle")
  .attr("cx", function(d){return d.x;})
  .attr("cy", function(d){return d.y;})
```

//How are we going to expand attribute-setter-maps when the data is just a scalar collection?
//Is that magical scope going to be confusing for users? Maybe when they're doing subsets and binding vars in a (doseq)...


Unlike D3, C2 does not support nested looping via multiple calls to `.data()`.
Rather, C2's `(data)` function can only be called once for a given selection; nested elements can be constructed by explict use of Clojure's looping constructs like `(doseq)`:

```clojure
(doseq [[something-val, subset] (group-by :something the-data)]
  (append svg (dotplot subset, :scale s))
  (append svg (label something-val)))
```






Motivations
-----------

In D3 one tends to mix essential visualization data aesthetics with incidental layout code.
To make a bar chart you might write something like

```javascript
d3.select("#my-svg")
.selectAll(".bar")
.data([9, 2, 4, 11, 19, 13])
.enter().append("svg:rect")
.attr("class", "bar")
.attr("height", function(x, i){return x;}) //essential mapping
.attr("x", function(x, i){return i*bar_spacing;}); //incidental mapping
```

In C2, you would write something like

```clojure
(-> 
)
```




Samples
-------


```clojure
;; A graphical timecard like
;; http://raphaeljs.com/github/dots.html

;;Factor it into the two guides and dataframe.

(let [hourcard-data [{:day-of-week 0 :hour 0 :val 0}
                     {:day-of-week 0 :hour 1 :val 1.3}
                     {:day-of-week 6 :hour 13 :val 2.1}
                     {:day-of-week 3 :hour 11 :val 2}]
      svg (append "#timecard-chart" :svg)

      ;;Make the dataframe
      df-g (append svg :g {:id "timecard-df"})
      ;;The day-of-week guide on the left
      dow-guide (append svg :g {:id "dow-guide" :class "guide"})
      ;;The hour guide on the right
      hour-guide (append svg :g {:id "hour-guide" :class "guide"})

      width 800, height 300, max-radius 10

      ;;Make the two positional scales; min-max returns [min, max]
      scale-hour (scale/linear :domain (min-max timecard-data :dimension :hour)
                               :range [0 width])
      scale-dow (scale/linear :domain (min-max timecard-data :dimension :day-of-week)
                              :range [0 height])
      ;;The radius scale has the same domain as the hour scale, so derive it.
      scale-radius (range scale-hour [0 max-radius])
      scale-colour (scale/linear :domain (min-max timecard-data :dimension :val)
                                 ;;The Raphael example uses green->red, which is a terrible color scale for the colourblind.
                                 :range ["white" "blue"])]
  ;;Fill the dataframe
  (-> df-g
      (data ds) (append :circle {:class "hour-circle"
                                 :fill  (scale-colour val)
                                 :cx    (scale-hour hour)
                                 :cy    (scale-dow day-of-week)
                                 :r     (scale-radius val)}))

  ;;Append the day-of-week guide
  (-> dow-guide
      (append (guide scale-dow
                     :direction :vertical
                     ;;A function that accepts tick values in the domain.
                     ;;In this case, we're using vectors as functions; (["A", "B"] 1) ;;=> "B".
                     :text ["Mon" "Tue" "Wed" "Thur" "Fri" "Sat" "Sun"]
                     :tick nil))) ;;no tickmarks please
                     

  ;;And the hour guide
  (-> hour-guide
      (append (guide scale-hour
                     :direction :horizontal
                     :text #(condp = %
                                     0  "12am"
                                     12 "12pm"
                                     (mod % 12))
                     :tick nil)))) ;;no tickmarks please

```






Open questions
--------------
Should we abstract dealing with labels that are different than attribute values; `{:dow 0}` => "Sunday".







C2 rejects a custom scenegraph abstraction in favor of directly manipulating an existing standard (SVG).
The rational is the same as D3's; while custom abstractions may be more efficient for specifying certain visualizations---a bar chart or a line chart---they ultimately limit expressiveness.
See section one of the [D3 paper](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-D3-InfoVis.pdf) (PDF link).


Differences from D3
-------------------

D3 is a language for constructing bespoke visualizations on web, not generating plots (sayith Bostock: "D3 is not a charting library!").
While many people use D3 to create charts, 


C2 is focused only on the construction of static statistical graphics; it does not support transitions or animations.
This is because

1) It's easier to implement a static system.
2) Good information design is good graphic design: we want output suitable for print, as well as the web.
3) Interactivity in information software is very hard to do well anyway. We agree with Bret Victor's take in [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#interactivity_considered_harmful).
